  <section id="introduction">
    <div class="paragraph">Humans, like all animals, have an innate sense of where we are in the world and where we are
      going. We use it everywhere - to walk home, to go to the grocery store, to walk to the bathroom in the middle of
      the night. </div>
    <div class="paragraph">How we navigate is largely dependent on what information is available to us. Among those is beaconing, a strategy where
    we use a distant object to navigate to - say, “Hey, there’s a neon sign here saying ‘Pub’” - that’s probably the
    entrance to the pub. But what if you don’t have those clues? This is where path integration comes in.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">Say you're out on a hike with your friends. You’re full of energy during the day and make plenty of detours before you
    get to the campsite and settle in for a restful night, listening to the soothing patter of rain on the tent.</div>
    <div class="paragraph"> <strong>Tragedy strikes!</strong> It's the middle of the night and you're woken up in what an optimist would call a
      'puddle', and anyone else might label 'a decidedly sizable body of water'.</div>
    <div class="paragraph"><em>So much for the guy on Facebook Marketplace promising that the tent was waterproof.</em></div>
    <div class="paragraph">You and your friend make the decision to trek back to the car park. You wish one of you had brought a headlamp at least
    - you can't use any landmarks to navigate. Despite that, you somehow manage to make it back in one piece, going straight
    from the campsite to the carpark without any of the diversions you had undertaken on the way there. How?</div>

    <div class="paragraph">Two types of sensory information are required to update where we think we are: Allothetic
      information we get from the outside environment, like that ‘Pub’ sign. Idiothetic information is generated by the
      body itself. For example, the brain signals responsible for walking to the pub also provide us with
      information about how far we’ve walked so far. Path integration uses these idiothetic cues to transverse the mental
      map in our head. For example, a mouse that is foraging and takes a long, winding trajectory towards its goal will
      have ‘calculated’ its displacement from its nest and can make a beeline safely back if it suddenly runs into a
      fox.

    <div class="paragraph">
      Studying path integration is
      complicated by the fact that it’s only one part of the mechanism behind navigation. It’s an error-prone system,
      and so it works in combination with other information to create a path - for example, a mouse might use remembered
      landmarks, olfaction and even way-marking to navigate through an environment. Studying the neurons specifically
      involved in path integration therefore requires us to remove all other possibilities but using path integration.
      How do we do <em>that?</em></div>
    <div class="container">
      <img class="comic" src="./images/pi_exp_1.png" alt="Path integration experiment">
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">One way of studying path integration is using virtual reality. Mice run through a VR corridor on a treadmill until
    there’s a visual cue. If they stop at the visual cue, they get a treat. After a few repetitions, the visual cue is
    removed - yet the mice still stop in the place where the visual cue <em>would have been</em>. If there are no external cues for
    the mice to see, how do they know when to stop?<p></p> The mice can’t use other navigational strategies, such as beaconing,
    because there’s no allothetic cues, so they’re left with path integration. They might have remembered the time it took
    to run to the reward zone - but when the speed of the treadmill was changed, the mice didn’t overshoot the reward zone,
    despite running faster. This implies they weren’t measuring the time, but were instead getting their information from a
    collection of self-motion cues. This includes proprioception (the sense of your self-position and self-movement) along
    with the vestibular system (your inner ear, which provides a sense of balance and awareness of our head and body in
    space) and motor efference. Over longer distances, the accuracy of this system drops without external input such as
    landmarks, as small errors start to accumulate and the mice start to stop further away from the reward zone.

    <div class="paragraph">Path integration is just one of the many navigational strategies we want to study to understand the basis of the neural map. There are many specialised cell types involved in navigation. For the purpose of this
      website, let’s focus on three: place cells, grid cells, and head direction cells.

          <p>
            <strong>Grid cells</strong>
          <p>are place-modulated neurons located primarily in the entorhinal cortex that fire periodically in space,
            mapping a triangular grid across an environment. As an animal moves through space, grid cells fire to create
            hexagonal patterns that allow us to map this space. Again, a population of grid cells alone can encode a
            spatial map</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <strong>Place cells</strong>
          <p> located in the hippocampus, fire when an animal enters a specific location in space. A population of place
            cells alone can encode a spatial map.
            .</p>
          <p></p>
          <p></p>
          <strong>Head direction cells</strong>
          <p>are primarily found in the postsubiculum, and provide directional information by preferentially firing in
            specific directions. A population of head direction cells can encode which direction you are facing in your
            spatial map.
          </p>
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>These cells potentially have uses outside of encoding physical space - their coding mechanism may be used
            for more general problem sets, such as cognitive mapping. Cognitive mapping refers to swapping out the
            three-dimensional world we interact with for a different, continuous dimension that represents an abstract
            concept. The same way we might encode the map of our room, we might use the hexagonal-firing properties of
            grid cells to represent, for example, conceptual spaces, such as hierarchically organizing ideas within our
            brain, or recording temporal sequences of events.</p>

      </div>
      <p></p>
    <div class="paragraph">Why do we want to understand the neuroscience behind mechanisms of navigation?</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Concepts behind spatial mapping can be generalized to more complex cognitive behaviors. For an
        animal to know where it
        is and where it is going, it must have an understanding of the relations between itself and other structures. Some
        theories envisage the ‘cognitive map’ as a system of relational structures that can be navigated through, with grid
        cell
        mechanisms encoding abstract relationships between ideas and states - i.e. instead of knowing where you are in
        relation
        to another location, you can encode how events relate to each other and build up a model in your mind. Grid cell
        representations of tasks may help us with two important abilities that allow for complex behaviour - the ability to
        generalize what we have learned from one task to further tasks, and the ability to infer from our knowledge of
        relations
        between events and make assumptions about future events in new scenarios. Grid cells and other features behind
        encoding of our spatial understanding might therefore be a solution to
        some of the big questions behind our higher-order ‘thinking’ processes.</div>
      <!-- In the hi
ppocampal formation, we might find <strong>boundary cells</strong>; as with head direction cells, these
      boundary cells are relatively self-explanatory. These fire when a specific receptive field intersected an
      environmental boundary, dependent solely on location and not on the direction of the animal -->
    </div>
    <!-- <div class="paragraph">Path integration is computed by grid cells within the medial entorhinal cortex and downstream
      ‘readout’ cells. What we want to find out is <strong>how grid cells collect and store data about location and
        movement</strong>, and <strong>how this information is then transferred and ‘read’ by cells in the
        hippocampus</strong>. -->
    <!-- <p></p>Grid cells provide a good mechanism for path integration as they are context-independent codes of distance.
      New environments and new contexts will lead to new sensory inputs, and information coding for spatial
      representation must therefore be generalizable across these differing conditions. Grid cells are close to input
      about speed and head direction and connect in the MEC with the hippocampus, which is generally thought of as an
      area used for read-out and storage of information about location. Continuous attractor dynamics functions as a
      theoretical framework of grid cell encoding of spatial information, wherein grid cells receive and integrate
      self-motion information, firing in a hexagonal-grid pattern as the animal moves through space and generating bumps
      of activity that morphs in response to the animal’s location. The activities of different neurons work together
      dynamically to inhibit or excite each other.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">Grid cells provide a coordinate system for the brain - like looking at a graph and seeing
      that a certain point is at an x-coordinate and y-coordinate, which tells us information about that data point.
      Generally, neighbouring grid cells belong to the same <strong>module</strong> - they have the same orientation and
      scale. Activity of cells in different modules is combined to get the exact location of the animal, as reading out
      information from just one grid cell would give us only a vague estimate of our position. Grid cells must be
      anchored to salient features in an environment to allow for correct calculations of distance. While path
      integration is a process that doesn’t rely on environmental information to create this internal “map”, it
      accumulates errors over time, which need to be corrected by allothetic cues and information from border cells.
      <p></p>
      An interesting question that has been posed is the boundary problem: what happens when an animal moves past the
      boundaries of this two-dimensional internal map? A potential answer imagined the connected continuous attractor
      networks of grid cells as a torus. A torus is basically shaped like a donut - so the network is connected together
      in this circular manner to prevent the possibility of leaving the boundaries.

  <div class="paragraph">To summarise the model that we’ve touched upon so far, place cells in the hippocampus fire when
    you enter a location that is within their place field. But while place cells tell you your location, you need more
    information to make your way through the world - you need to know information such as your direction (which is
    decoded from head direction cells), and very importantly, how far you’ve travelled to get where you are (a
    displacement vector), for which we use grid cells within the entorhinal cortex. But how does your brain actually
    interpret this information? How is it able to look at these cells firing and work back from that to actually tell
    you your displacement vector?
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">A proposed computational model depicts this readout mechanism as information from the grid
    phases inputting to a network, which outputs to a neuron that has a firing rate proportional to the displacement of
    the animal. Essentially the collective modules of grid cells output to an intermediate <strong>ramping</strong>
    cell. The word ramping is used because the cell firing profile looks like a ramp - it might be going up or going
    down as you reach a goal location, for example. </div>
  <div class=paragraph>Why use ramping profiles to encode information?
    If we had an infinite amount of cells, we could encode information in a discrete way. However, we're working with a
    limited (but still very large!) pool of neurons. While encoding positional estimate using discrete firing fields
    would require us to compare firing rates within a population, using a continuous ramping profile could give us that
    same information from just one neuron!</div>
