        <div class="paragraph">Humans, like all other animals, have an innate sense of where we are in the world and where we are going. We use it everywhere - to walk home from a club, to go to the grocery store, to walk from our room to our bathroom at night. Our
        brains use different methods to accurately navigate. Among those is beaconing, a strategy where we use sensory features
        of a distant object to navigate to it - say, ‘Hey, there’s a neon sign here saying ‘Pub’ - that’s probably the entrance
        to the pub, I should move towards it’ or ‘The sound of people screaming getting louder probably means I’m going in the
        right direction for my football match’. But what if you don’t have those clues? This is where path integration comes in. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Imagine you're out on a hike with your friends. You drive up to the base of a formidable mountain, already regretting having agreed to wake up at 5am to spend the rest of your weekend hot, sweaty, choked by swarms of mosquitos and trudging up a mountain. You put on your best smile as your far fitter friend enthusiastically tells you about the plan - they want to hike to a lake to go for a swim, then make your first ascent up a ridge, go to a mountain hut for some food... With a heavy pack and groaning feet, you zigzag across the area from landmark to landmark, until you finally settle down in the campsite. </div>
        <div class="paragraph">Except - damn. It's the middle of the night and you're woken up in what an optimist would call a 'puddle', and anyone else might label 'a decidedly sizable body of water'.</div>  
        <div class="paragraph">So much for the guy on Facebook Marketplace promising that the tent was waterproof.</div>
        <div class="paragraph">You and your friend make the decision to trek back to the car park and the warmth. You wish one of you had brought a headlamp at least - you can't use any landmarks to navigate. Despite that, you somehow manage to make it back in one peace, going straight from the campsite to the carpark without any of the diversions you had undertaken on the way there. How did you manage that?</div>
        <div>THIS IS WHERE THE GAME WILL GO</div>
        <div></div>
        <div class="paragraph">The brain takes two forms of cues to update its understanding of position: <strong>allothetic</strong> and <strong>idiopathic</strong> cues. <strong>Allothetic</strong> cues are information that you get from the outside environment. When you’re making your way from your room to your
        kitchen to grab a snack, you can see that the door is getting closer, that you’ve passed that ugly painting your partner
        put up on the wall and the bathroom is right next to you, so your brain says “Aha yes, I’m about this far from the
        kitchen and that far from my room”. Conversely, <strong>idiopathic</strong> cues refer to information from your internal environment. If
        you’re going to get a snack at 2am and you don’t want to turn on the lights to wake up your family, you’re still
        somewhat aware of where you are in your mental map of your house. Although you can’t see the painting or the shoes, you
        probably have an estimate of how far you have to walk before reaching the crisp shelf.
        Path integration uses these idiopathic cues to form a mental map of an environment. A mouse that is hunting at night and
        takes a long, winding trajectory towards its goal will have ‘calculated’ its displacement from its starting position and can
        make a beeline safely back to its nest if it suddenly runs into a fox.</div>
        <div>THIS IS WHERE THE GAME PART 2: THE MOUSE WILL GO</div>
        <div class="paragraph">Why do we want to understand path integration?
        Path integration can tell us about mechanisms behind animal biology and strategies of migration; in humans, it might
        lead to a better understanding of how we process and understand sensory information and the cognitive processes behind
        it. The algorithms that are elucidated from biological systems can be applied to mechanical systems, or even used in
        healthcare to understand ways to improve navigation aids for patients where navigation has been impaired, such as due to
        vision loss.
        Studying path integration is complicated by the fact that it’s only one part of the mechanism behind navigation. It’s an
        error-prone system, and so it works in combination with other information to create a path - for example, a mouse might
        use remembered landmarks, olfaction and even way-marking to navigate through an environment. Studying the neurons
        specifically involved in path integration therefore requires us to remove all other possibilities but using path
        integration. How do we do that?</div>
        <img class = "comic" src="../images/pi_exp_1.png" alt="Path integration experiment">
        <div class="paragraph">Dead reckoning  was investigated using a virtual reality experiment. Mice ran through a repeated corridor on a virtual reality track until there was a visual cue, such as yellow stripes. If they stopped at the visual cue, they would be given a treat. Once the mice made the association that stopping at that specific point got them a treat, the visual cue was removed and the mice were put back on the track. Despite the visual cue being removed, the mice had learned they would get a treat if they stopped in that specific place kept stopping in the place where the visual cue WOULD HAVE BEEN. This virtual reality track served as an environment for mice to run in where they couldn’t use any allothetic cues - the researchers removed the possibility of them using other navigational strategies, such as beaconing, to study path integration specifically. 
        If there were no external cues for the mice to us, how did they know when to stop?
        One possiblity was that they estimated the time it took for them to run and stopped when they ran the same amount of time; the researchers tested for this by changing the speed of the treadmill and investigating whether mice that ran faster would overshoot the reward zone. This would happen if they had measured the time necessary for them to reach it and now, running faster, they covered more distance in less time. However, the mice didn't stop at the wrong place when they ran faster for a shorter period of time - the mice therefore weren’t measuring time. What <strong>were</strong> they measuring? They were getting their information from a collection of self-motion cues. This includes something called proprioception, which is a sense of how your body is positioned, along with the vestibular system (your inner ear, which provides a sense of balance and awareness of our head and body in space) and motor efference. Over longer distances, the accuracy of this system drops without external input such as landmarks, as small errors start to accumulate and the mice start to stop further away from the reward zone.
